  2.  for Analysis
- PivotCharts for data Visualization
- Github for portfolio building

  ### Data cleaning
  data cleaning involves several processes. to ensure data accuracy, completeness and consistency, here is a step-by-step process.
  - handling missing files
    1. identify missing values (e.g, NULL, blank, NA).
    2. decide on replacement stategies (e.g,  mean, median, imputation).
    3. replace missing values
   
    - data normalization
      1. standardize date formats
      2. convert categorical variables into numerical variables

      - error detection and correction
        1. identify errors
        2. correct errors manually or using algorithms
        3. verify corrections

        - data transformation
          1. aggregate data (e.g, group by, pivot)
          2. merge datasets
          3. transpose data
         
          -data validation
