# DOCUMENTATION_OF_LITA_PROJECT

### project title: Sales Analysis Report

This analysis project aims at outlining the sales activity and the impact it has brought to the organisation over a specific time. The details can vary, but typically include metrics about leads, new accounts won, revenue generated, and overall sales performance. this will give us insight about the lows and highs of the sales generated and how improvement can be made on the sales.

### Data sources
the primary sources of data used for this project are;  sales records, customer feedback, and operational metrics. with some external sources such as market research reports and the industry benchmarks.

### Tools used
- Microsoft Excel [download here](https://www.microsoft.com)
  1.  for Data cleaning
  2.  for Analysis
- PivotCharts for data Visualization
- Github for portfolio building
  
  ### Data cleaning
  data cleaning involves several processes. to ensure data accuracy, completeness and consistency, here is a step-by-step process.
- handling missing files
  1. identify missing values (e.g, NULL, blank, NA).
  2. decide on replacement stategies (e.g,  mean, median, imputation).
  3. replace missing values
- data normalization
  1. standardize date formats
  2. convert categorical variables into numerical variables
- error detection and correction
  1. identify errors
  2. correct errors manually or using algorithms
  3. verify corrections
- data transformation
  1. aggregate data (e.g, group by, pivot)
  2. merge datasets
  3. transpose data
-data validation

### Expolatory data analysis (EDA)
EDA involves examining and summarizing data to understand patterns, trends and corrections. here is a comprehensive EDA checklist.
 -  what are the top-selling products/category
 -  which regions/territories generate most most sales
 -  how do sales vary by season/holiday
 -  which customer segments drive most sales
 -  what marketing channels are most effective

### Data analysis
As a data analyst, the first thing that should be in mind after importing your data is to clean the data, prepare the data and summarize the data.
this is where we do an explicit explanation of our data.
in preparation of data, 
- you imported data
- clean and format data. i.e removing duplicates, handling missing files etc.
- and finally, organise your data into tables or pivot tables.
